    <h2>Pluralsight Skills</h2>

    <h1>Where teams build better<br>technology skills, faster</h1>

    <p>Technology teams are only as successful as their skills are relevant. <br>
    Give them access to Pluralsight Skills—courses, assessments, learning paths, and labs <br>
    and you give them the tech fluency they need to build business-critical skills.</p>
